# Vector Content In PPT

Embed AI vector content into PPT without quality loss and preserve transparency:

1. Complete AI work
2. Create outlines for all type layers (consider a separate artboard and file to preserve master file)
3. Scale artwork to an oversized state (400%)
4. Export artword as an _enhanced media file_ (.emf)
5. Import .emf file into PPT
6. Change the scale as needed in PPT
