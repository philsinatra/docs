# 11ty

- [Navigation Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)

After installing the plugin and adding it to the `.eleventy.js` configuration file, you can add `eleventyNavigation` meta information to each of your pages/posts:

```markdown
---
tags: page
eleventyNavigation:
  key: Main Menu
  order: 10
---
```

You can customize the display text using the `title` key:

```markdown
---
tags: page
eleventyNavigation:
  key: Module 1 Screen 1
  title: The Happy Dog
  order: 30
---
```

## Building a Menu

The example code in the documentation for building a basic menu works perfectly:

```html
<ul>
{%- for entry in navPages %}
  <li{% if entry.url == page.url %} class="my-active-class"{% endif %}>
    <a href="{{ entry.url | url }}">{{ entry.key }}: {{ entry.title }} (order: {{ entry.order }})</a>
  </li>
{%- endfor %}
</ul>
```

### Next/Previous Links

You can build next and previous links by comparing the `page.url` with each `entry.url`:

```html
{% set navPages = collections.all | eleventyNavigation %} {# {{ navPages | dump
| safe }} #} {%- for entry in navPages %} {% if entry.url == page.url %} {% if
navPages[loop.index0 - 1].url %}
<p>
  <a href="{{navPages[loop.index0 - 1].url}}">PREVIOUS</a>
</p>
{% endif %} {% if navPages[loop.index0 + 1].url %}
<p>
  <a href="{{navPages[loop.index0 + 1].url}}">NEXT</a>
</p>
{% endif %} {% endif %} {%- endfor %}
```

## Add CSS to 11ty

One of the things that was a bit confusing when first setting up an 11ty project was getting certain files and folders in the project’s folder structure from showing up in the output `_site` folder.

An example might be if you wanted to add some CSS to your site and all your CSS files live in a folder at the root of your project called css. By default, 11ty will not output this folder into its `_site`.

In order to have 11ty copy the css folder through to the `_site` output folder, you’ll need to add what’s called a pass through in your 11ty configuration file.

First in your project folder, at the root make sure you’ve got a file called `.eleventy.js`.

```txt
.
├── .eleventy.js
├── _includes
├── _site
├── css
└── index.md
```

Next in your `.eleventy.js` configuration file, you’ll want to add this:

```javascript
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy('css')
  return {
    passthroughFileCopy: true,
  }
}
```

What `eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy('css')` does is tells 11ty to look for a folder named css and copy it through to the output folder. The `passthroughFileCopy: true` is needed in order to use the `addPassthroughCopy` function.

Now when you either serve from the command line or look in the `_site` output folder, you’ll see that your `css` folder has also passed through. Now in your template file you can reference your stylesheet like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/relax.css" />
```

And it’ll render because it’s in your output folder.
